# Requests
## Get the request body
### Import BaseModel from pydantic
```py
from pydantic import BaseModel
```
### Create your data model
```py
from pydantic import BaseModel

class TranslationModel(BaseModel):
    text: str
    to_language: str
```

### To add it to your path operation, declare it the same way you declared path and query parameters:

# Deploy on heroku
## Create a virtual environment for python
```
> python -m venv env
```
## Activate the virtual environment
```
> env\Scripts\activate
```
## Upgrade pip
```
> python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```
## Install packages
```
> pip install fastapi
> pip install translators
> pip install uvicorn
> pip install gunicorn (This one is needed for the deployment on heroku)
```
## Save all project dependencies to a file
```
> pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
## To install the dependencies mentioned in requirements.txt
```
> pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Create a Procfile file (no extension)

```
- Procfile
```
web: gunicorn -w 4 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker main:app
```
- web : is specific to Procfile command convention that will help identify the Heroku deployment process to start a web application with the command next to it.
- gunicorn is the WSGI server to which we are configuring our application to run on, with the following configuration.
- -w 4 indicates that we need our application to run on gunicorn with 4 worker processes.
- -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker tells the gunicorn to run the application using uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker worker class.
main:app is our module main where our FastAPI() app is initialized.
