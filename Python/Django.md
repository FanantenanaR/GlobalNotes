# Creating the Polls app

## Projects vs apps
```
- App : A web application that does something, for example a blog system, a database of public records or a small poll app.

- Project : Collection of configuration and apps for a particular website.

A project can contain multiple apps and an app can be in multiple projects.
```

## Creation of the poll
**To create your app, make sure youâ€™re in the same directory as manage.py**

```
python3 manage.py startapp polls
```
## Write your first view
### Create the view
```py
# polls/views.py

from django.http import HttpResponse

def index(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello world")
```

### Call the view
```py
# polls/urls.py

from django.urls import path

from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('',views.index, name='index'),
]
```

```py
# mysite/urls.py

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import include, path

urlpatterns = [
    path('polls/', include('polls.urls')),
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls)
]
```

### Test it
```
- Run the server : python3 manage.py runserver
- Go to localhost:8000/polls
```
